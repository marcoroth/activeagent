Description:
    Generates a new agent and its views. Passes the agent name, either
    CamelCased or under_scored, and an optional list of prompts as arguments.

    This generates a agent class in app/agents and invokes your template
    engine and test framework generators.

Examples:
    `bin/rails generate active_agent:agent inventory search`

    creates a sign up mailer class, views, and test:
        Agent:     app/agents/inventory_agent.rb
        Views:      app/views/inventory_agent/search.text.erb [...]
        Test:       test/agents/inventory_agent_test.rb

    `bin/rails generate active_agent:agent inventory search update report`

    creates an inventory agent with search, update, and report actions.
